# Maxim Salnikov's sessions at NIC 2023

## Using the power of OpenAI with your own data: what's possible and how to start?

The top questions we get about ChatGPT-powered enterprise scenarios are all about using the company's own data as the basis for the responses. In this session, we'll explore various options starting from simply injecting data into the prompt to the advanced architectures with multiple Cognitive Services chained together and fine-tuning models - all for you to choose the flexible, scalable, and cost-efficient solution that works the best for you.

## If your code could speak, what would it tell you? Let GitHub Copilot Chat help you find out!

Have you been in the situation where you need to remember what is this code written by you some time ago about? Not even saying about you trying to understand someone else's code? GitHub Copilot Chat is a new way to code, where you can write code, fix bugs, write tests, and explain code to yourself and others in a chat window in a sidebar or inline. In this session, I'll demonstrate how GitHub Copilot Chat takes developer experience to the next level and how it can help you be more productive in your day-to-day work.
